# Swatch Home Assistant Integration

Provides the following:

- Binary Sensor entities (Object + Zone detection)
- Support for multiple Swatch instances.

## Installation

Easiest install is via [HACS](https://hacs.xyz/):

`HACS -> Explore & Add Repositories -> Swatch`

Notes:

- HACS does not "configure" the integration for you. You must go to `Configuration > Integrations` and add Swatch after installing via HACS.

For manual installation for advanced users, copy `custom_components/swatch` to
your `custom_components` folder in Home Assistant.

Please visit the [main Swatch
documentation](https://github.com/NickM-27/swatch/)
for full installation instructions of this integration.

## Documentation

For full usage instructions, please see the [central Swatch documentation](https://github.com/NickM-27/swatch/).
